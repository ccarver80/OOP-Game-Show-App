# OOP-Game-Show-App

## Created by Chris Carver

See this in action at [Phrase Hunter Game](https://ccarver80.github.io/OOP-Game-Show-App/)

### Objective: 

I was given a basic HTML/CSS template from Team Treehouse and was told to create a Phrase Hunter game show app using OOP. 

I built in for extra credit a simple "keyup" event listener so you can use your keyboard to guess the phrase as well

I also added a Wins: Losses: score that updates and keeps a record of how many times you won or lost. 

I also changed the background colors.
